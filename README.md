# DFS Implementation in Python

The python notebook consists of a Depth First Search implementation on the Homer Iliad dataset in networkx. It also includes the application of finding the connected components of the graph using DFS.

## Components

* read_nodes - parses the input file and returns the nodes as a list
* read_edges - parses the input file and returns pairs of nodes as edges in a list
* Search - performs the DFS algorithm on networkx graph object and returns the list of nodes traversed in the order of first visited
* connected_components - finds the connected components and returns a list of them
